# UI Schema Contracts

This package stores JSON Schemas for governed UI metadata.

- `src/widget-manifest.schema.json`: required contract for widget manifests.
- `src/page-manifest.schema.json`: required contract for page manifests.
- `src/interface-manifest.schema.json`: required contract for governed API/MCP/script interfaces.

All contracts include explicit validation metadata so observed runtime behavior can stay distinct from approved product decisions.
