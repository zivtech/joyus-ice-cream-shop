# Widget Inspector API

## Contract

Runtime exposes:

```ts
getWidgetSpec(widgetId: string): {
  requested_id: string;
  widget_id: string;
  alias_applied: string | null;
  manifest: Record<string, unknown>;
  lineage: Record<string, unknown>;
  story_links: string[];
} | null
```

## Purpose

Provide explainability data in runtime and Storybook from a single widget identifier.

## Alias Support

Legacy widget IDs are resolved through a compatibility alias map before lookup.

## Coverage

- `hour_by_hour_gross_profit`
- `shift_planner_day_card`
