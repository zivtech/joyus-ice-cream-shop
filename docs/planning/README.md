# Joyus Ice Cream Shop Planning Hub

Last updated: 2026-02-24

## Purpose
This folder is the single planning control center for Joyus Ice Cream Shop.

It consolidates:
- the business/feature intent,
- current implementation clarification,
- in-flight agent deltas,
- recovered planning artifacts from worktrees,
- and the execution backlog.

## Read order
1. `00-baseline-constitution.md`
2. `01-product-charter.md`
3. `02-source-of-truth-map.md`
4. `03-current-agent-delta.md`
5. `04-execution-backlog.md`
6. `05-decision-log.md`

## Guardrail
Do not delete or rewrite recovered docs under `recovered/` until they are either:
1. merged into canonical docs in this repo, or
2. explicitly marked superseded in `05-decision-log.md`.

Use `recovered/README.md` as the provenance index for historical planning artifacts.
