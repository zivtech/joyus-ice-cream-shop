# Decision Log

## 2026-02-24
1. Canonical planning hub is `docs/planning/` in `joyus-ice-cream-shop`.
2. Page-first clarification remains the active approach.
3. Legacy `joyus-fast-casual` content remains archived, not deleted.
4. Data policy: no hourly refresh/rebuild during clarification without explicit approval.

## Pending decisions
1. Final manifest path convention:
- flat files vs nested `<id>/page.manifest.json` and `<id>/widget.manifest.json`.
2. Storybook rollout timing:
- immediate baseline vs phase-2 after clarification freeze.
3. Governance gate strictness for early commits.
4. Naming convergence from historical `joyus-fast-casual` to `joyus-ice-cream-shop` across all artifacts.
