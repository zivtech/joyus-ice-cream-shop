# Recovered Planning Artifacts Index

Status: preserved, linked, and read-only until explicitly superseded.

## Purpose
- Keep historically useful planning work accessible while canonical governance artifacts are built in this repo.
- Prevent loss of context for APIs, UX decisions, and roadmap assumptions during migration.

## Artifact index
1. `joyus-fast-casual-feature-tracker-2026-02-21.md`
   - Scope: roadmap slices (`Now`, `Next`, `Later`, `Deferred`) and API/tool mappings.
2. `joyus-fast-casual-data-sync-foundation-2026-02-21.md`
   - Scope: sync/export/recompute/compliance endpoint and MCP tool inventory.
3. `joyus-fast-casual-ux-runtime-notes-2026-02-21.md`
   - Scope: planner UX patterns and runtime migration recommendations.

## Canonical mapping
1. Governed contracts:
   - `packages/ui-manifests/`
   - `packages/ui-schemas/`
2. Clarification docs:
   - `docs/clarification/pages/*.md`
   - `docs/clarification/widgets/*.md`
3. Decision and execution control:
   - `docs/planning/04-execution-backlog.md`
   - `docs/planning/05-decision-log.md`

## Rule
- Do not edit recovered artifact content except metadata/provenance annotations.
- Move decisions into canonical docs/manifests before treating them as active implementation truth.
