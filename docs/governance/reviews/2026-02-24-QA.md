  1. Who's building this? You + AI assistants? Other developers on the team? If so, what are their strongest
  languages/frameworks?   
  >>Me + AI assistants + possibly my team of 2-3 developers. We have experience with PHP, Python, Go, or really any other language. We are also experts in Drupal
  
  2. Do you have production ops experience with any particular stack? (Managing servers, deployments,        
  debugging production issues)

  >>Yes, we have experience managing servers, deployments, and debugging production issues. We are familiar with various hosting platforms and have experience with both traditional server management and cloud-based solutions.

  How Milk Jawn Actually Works Today

  3. Which delivery platforms does Milk Jawn currently use? (DoorDash, UberEats, Grubhub, others?)
  >> DoorDash

  4. How do delivery orders come in — through Square, or on separate tablets?

  >> Seperate Tablets 

  5. How often do managers interact with the scheduling tool? (Daily? Weekly on a specific day?)
>> The tool we're building? The managers currently make the schedules in Square and the onwer reviews

  6. Are managers using phones, tablets, or desktops for this?
  >> All of them

  Scale & Growth

  7. How many employees across both locations currently?

  >> 20-30 employees across both locations. 

  8. Roughly how many transactions per day across both locations?
  >> Roughly 100-150 transactions per day across both locations.

  9. For the platform business — what's your realistic target? 5 tenants in year 1? 50? 500?
  >> I'd love to offer this to other ice cream owners to use, and some of that I might we willing to foot the bill for as a gift to those owners, but I'd need to understsand the costs

  10. Are you targeting only ice cream/frozen dessert shops, or broader food service?
  >> Initially, we are targeting ice cream and frozen dessert shops, but we are open to expanding to broader food service in the future if there is demand for it. While ice cream is highly seasonal other businesseses might be less seasonal and could use the tool year round.

Infrastructure

  11. Do you have existing hosting infrastructure? (Pantheon account, AWS, etc.)
  >> Yes, we host on AWS, Linode, Platform.sh, Acquia, and Pantheon. We have experience with all of these platforms and can choose the one that best fits our needs for this project.


  12. Budget range for monthly hosting at launch? ($20/mo? $200/mo? $2000/mo?)
  >> What's the cheapest option that meets our needs? Let's start with a budget of $100-$200 per month. We can find a hosting solution that fits within that budget while still providing the necessary performance and reliability for our application.

2. What action changes because this exists?
 - "Scenario comparison (6-day vs 7-day, DoorDash on/off, manager scenarios) enables what-if analysis."

>> The 6 vs 7 day is a specific question for Milk Jawn. Business owners will want to set up scenarios / ask questions of the system during onboarding. Also, doordash is only one delivery option. We likely will want to show it with our without this activity. We also might not have this information available at all times, or it might update under a different cycle, so we will need to consider that. The what ifs are on boarding and ongoing improvement questions. 

 - Excel export provides data portability for offline analysis.
>> we need to determine what is useful to have in the excel before we decide this is the right place for the export. I can imagine there are several items that might be useful to export and outside of the dashboard.

>> Other items: 
* Should we put all widgets we develop onto the page? Can we allow users to add/remove/move widgets? 
* If a widget is more fully explained on another page we should link to that page from the widget.

(note that the widgets haven't been validated yet)
## Constitution test
1. Which decision does this support?
>> Missing decisions or questions. Maybe there is something somewhere else?: 

* how do we create the proposed schedules? Can we check if a previous schedule violated the guardrails? If so, we need to know that we are prposing something differently. 
* how does a proposed schedule compare to the same week in a previous year or average years 
* how do we assign someone a "regular" shift? How do we handle PTO or shift change request? 
* we need a way to determine what happens when a guardrail conflicts with margin goals or what happens when a guardrail changes

> 3. Permission model distinguishes manager (view, edit, submit) and admin (view, edit, approve, export) capabilities, though enforcement is front-end only.

## Findings
3. Permission model distinguishes manager (view, edit, submit) and admin (view, edit, approve, export) capabilities, though enforcement is front-end only.
>> Note that we already discussed the need for a different set of roles permissions and we will need settings associated

>> notes
* Ultimately I need to make sure that the various analytics are determined to be useful.
* I think we will want to have an AI bot create a summary of what changes in that period.
* we need to account for guardrails, both by giving some sort of indication when a shift appears a certain way 


# 2026-02-24-seasonal-playbook-page-review.md

>> optimizing for seasonality is one of the core missions of the system, so I want to make sure we think through the functionality here before we implement it. Some ideas/questions:
* I think (but am not sure) it makes most sense to injest all of the historical data first (sales and staffing), look at how sales changes historically were effected by the seasons, look at how we performed from a margin perspective and then recommend different "seasons" based upon those findings. 
* We currently assume there will be two step up and two step up periods, but is that sufficient or should we look for more nunace?
* given that the guardrails may not have been in place in the past
* when guardrails change we may need to rerun our playbook
* I want this page to clearly show what the seasonal assumptions are, indicate what actions should be upcoming to prepare for the new season, and show how guardrails are affecting the items (if they are)

# 2026-02-24-settings-page-review.md

>>Comments / Questions: 
* I **think** that the power of using Joyus and having this all in specs and ARDs and such is that we will be able to allow for a much more customized/customizable software for each different company, so I really just want to make sure that we put the right things in the settings, vs things that we might just "set and forget" during the build process.
